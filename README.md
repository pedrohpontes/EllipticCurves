# EllipticCurves
A Java library for elliptic curves and implementations of some elliptic curves algorithms: Lenstra's factorization and ECDSA.

# Description
EllCurve.java: the main class defining elliptic curves.

EllCurvePoint.java: implements the definition of a point in an elliptic curve and some arithmetic operations.

LenstrasFactorization.java: an implementation of Lenstra's algorithm to try to factor an integer.

ECSign.java: Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (incomplete).

The 'main' methods offer an example of usage but no user interface (one must alter the code to alter the integer to be factored for example).

# Reference
All the algorithms are based on the following textbook:
Joseph H. Silverman, The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves. Springer, 2nd Edition, 2009.

#Feedback
The author is a beginner in coding, so any feedback would be greatly appreciated!
